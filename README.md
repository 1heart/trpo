# Trust Region Policy Optimization

This repository hosts a presentation and implementation of the Trust Region Policy Optimization algorithm, as described in [Schulman et al.](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/schulman15.pdf).

The presentation is located [here](http://yixinlin.net/trpo/presentation.pdf).
